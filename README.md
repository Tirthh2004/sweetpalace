Introduction:
- This is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend and Django for the backend.
- It helps manage a sweet shop by allowing users to register, log in, view available sweets, and make purchases.
- Admin can delete, and restock sweets.
- Users can browse and purchase sweets. 

Key Features:
- User authentication (register & login)
-	View all available sweets
-	Search and filter sweets by name, category, or price
-	Add sweets to the cart and purchase them
-	Quantity decreases after purchase
-	Admin access to manage sweets (add, delete, update — inventory only)
-	Fully Responsive: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
-	Backend: Python (Django) 
-	Database: MongoDB Atlas 
-	Authentication: Secure login system using JWT and hashed password encryption.

My AI Usage:
Tools Used:
- ChatGPT: Used for brainstorming logic, designing the infrastructure of the system, and thinking through complex functionality.
-	Claude AI: Helped in debugging code and resolving backend/frontend errors efficiently.
-	Lovable AI: Assisted with user interface design ideas and improving overall UI/UX layout.

Usage 
-	Generated basic REST endpoint structure for Django backend.
-	Used AI to speed up writing test cases and model serializers.
-	React UI components scaffolded with suggestions, then customized manually.

Reflection 
- AI tools were used not to replace core development, but to augment my workflow and boost creativity. Their impact included:
  o	Saving time on boilerplate and repetitive tasks.
  o	Offering alternative solutions or approaches I hadn’t considered.
  o	Helping me stay unblocked during the development and testing phases.
-	I carefully reviewed all AI-generated code and made critical decisions based on the project’s goals, ensuring all logic aligned with real-world requirements.
-	Transparency & Ethics: AI tools were acknowledged in relevant commits using Co-authored-by, and no external code was plagiarized. All solutions were guided, reviewed, and owned by me. 

Set Up Instructions:
1.	Clone the Repository
2.	Backend Setup (Django)
  o	cd server
  o	python -m venv venv
  o	venv\Scripts\activate
  o	pip install -r requirements.txt
  o	python manage.py migrate
  o	python manage.py runserver 
3.	Frontend Setup (React)
  o	cd client
  o	npm install
  o	npm run dev
4.	Testing 
  o Although I did not implement formal Test-Driven Development (TDD) or write automated test cases in this project, I ensured the application was thoroughly tested through manual testing at each development stage.
  o	Due to time constraints and academic focus as an M.Sc. AI-ML student, I focused on implementing a functional full-stack system and verifying its behaviour manually.
  o However, I understand the importance of TDD and automated testing in real-world projects and am continuing to improve my skills in this area.
  o	While I haven’t implemented it yet, I’m eager to learn more and apply proper testing practices in future projects.
